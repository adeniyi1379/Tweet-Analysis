# NG30DaysOfLearning Tweet Analysis

# Introduction

I am currently enrolled into 30days learning program on the data analysis track ogranised by theoyinbooke  and his team to upskilled student during this ongoing strike of nigeria 
university student

After 16 days of learning the organisers comes up with the project ideal to analyse our Hashtag on Twitter which this project is all about

# Data Source
The data was scape in jupterBook and converted to csv file, the csv file is availabe at [Here](https://github.com/theoyinbooke/30Days-of-Learning-Data-Analysis-Using-Power-BI-for-Students/tree/main/Twitter%20Data%20Web%20Scrape)

# Problem Statement
After much familairty with  this data then this Queations comes up to my mind

1. Who are the most active users of this HashTag?
2. Which part of the country are student enrolled most?
3. How many twitter users using this Hashtag?
4. which tools are people taking about?

# Data Cleaning/Transformation

This data was cleaned and transfomed in Power Queary Editor of power Query as the tool used for this project and the following steps were carrid out
1. Make the first row as header
2. Extract month name and month number from the date
3. Extract time from the date
4. Lastly extract day from the date

# Data Analysis and Visualzation
1. It was known About 250 twitter users have engage with this HashTag with 680 tweets and 2429 retweets
2. Also The Organise @TheOyinbooKe is the most active
3. Student from lagos and Oyo state are more engage in this ongoing learing 
4. student are more active during the weeks days mostly on wednesdays
5. Lastly student are having issues or more engaged with this tools namely GitHub, Power BI, Excel and Azure

# Recommendation
The Organisers should try and engaged student to talk about this onngoing event on social so that student can be 
more aware of it because the number of student enrolled to this programmed ir relativedly low to the number of university student
